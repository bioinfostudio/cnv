        # Copy Number Variation analysis 

        -   Understand and perform a simple copy number variation analysis on
            NGS data

        -   Become familiar with Sequenza

        -   Understand the CNV inference process as an interplay between depth
            of sequencing, cellularity and B-allele frequency

        -   Visualize CNV events by manual inspection
